# Snake-Game
==============

Running the program
-------------------
Move the snake using the arrow keys.

The game provides the following speed levels:

* Earthworm (very slow)
* Centipede (still too slow - but okay)
* Cobra (makes for interesting gameplay)
* Black Mamba (BE CAREFUL! - this is the fastest snake ever discovered)

For added challenge, players can select a level:

* None (open playing field)
* Box (the playing field is surrounded by walls)
* Rooms (the snake operates in a space of four rooms)
